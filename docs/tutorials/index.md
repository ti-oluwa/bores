## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial includes:

- **Objective**: What you'll build
- **Concepts**: What you'll learn
- **Step-by-step code**: Complete working examples
- **Explanation**: Why each step matters
- **Results**: What to expect
- **Next steps**: How to extend the example

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

1. [Installed BORES](../getting-started/installation.md)
2. Read and understood the [Core Concepts](../getting-started/core-concepts.md)
3. A text editor or IDE ready for writing code

!!! tip "Follow Along"
    The best way to learn is by **typing the code yourself**. Copy-paste is fast, but typing helps you understand!

## What You'll Build

By the end of these tutorials, you'll be able to:

- Build 1D, 2D, and 3D reservoir models
- Add production and injection wells
- Configure different well controls
- Run waterfloods and gas floods
- Implement miscible EOR
- Analyze and visualize results
- Save and load simulations
