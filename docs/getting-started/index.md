# Getting Started

Welcome to BORES. This section walks you through everything you need to go from a fresh Python environment to a running reservoir simulation. Whether you are setting up BORES for the first time or refreshing your understanding of the framework's design, these three guides have you covered.

    ---

    Build and run your first simulation in under 5 minutes. This hands-on tutorial walks through a complete workflow: defining a grid, building a reservoir model, configuring the simulation, running it, and inspecting results.

- :material-book-open-variant:{ .lg .middle } **Core Concepts**

    ---

    Understand the foundational ideas behind BORES: the simulation pipeline, immutable data models, dimension generics, sign conventions, field units, precision control, time management, and serialization. Read this before diving into advanced features.

## Recommended Reading Order

If you are brand new to BORES, follow these pages in order:

1. **Installation** - Get BORES installed and verify it works.
2. **Quickstart** - Run a complete simulation end to end.
3. **Core Concepts** - Build a mental model of how the framework is organized.

After completing these three pages, you will be ready to explore the [User Guide](../user-guide/index.md), [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md), and [API Reference](../api-reference/index.md) sections.
