# Installation

This page covers how to install BORES, verify your setup, and troubleshoot common issues. BORES supports Python 3.10 and above on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing BORES, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.10 or later** - BORES uses modern typing features and requires Python 3.10 as a minimum. You can check your version with `python --version`.
- **A C compiler** - Numba (used for JIT-compiled numerical kernels) occasionally needs to compile extensions. On Linux, `gcc` is typically available by default. On macOS, install Xcode command line tools with `xcode-select --install`. On Windows, the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools are sufficient.
- **A working internet connection** - Required to download BORES and its dependencies from PyPI.

BORES depends on several scientific Python packages that will be installed automatically:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| numpy | Array operations and linear algebra |
| scipy | Sparse matrix solvers and numerical methods |
| numba | JIT compilation for performance-critical functions |
| attrs / cattrs | Data models and serialization |
| h5py / zarr / orjson | HDF5, Zarr, and JSON storage backends |
| plotly | Visualization (series, maps, 3D volumes) |

## Install BORES

=== "uv (recommended)"

    [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package manager that handles dependency resolution efficiently. If you do not have `uv` installed yet, you can install it with:

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Then install BORES:

    ```bash
    uv add bores-framework
    ```

    If you are working from a cloned copy of the BORES repository, you can install it in development mode:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    This reads the `pyproject.toml` and installs all dependencies, including optional dev tools.

=== "pip"

    You can install BORES with standard pip:

    ```bash
    pip install bores-framework
    ```

    Or to ensure that pip uses an index for MKL-optimized numpy/scipy for x86_64 Linux/Windows:

    ```bash
    pip install bores-framework --extra-index-url https://urob.github.io/numpy-mkl
    ```

    For development mode from a local clone:

    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

!!! tip "Virtual Environments"

    Always install BORES inside a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages. With `uv`, virtual environments are managed automatically. With `pip`, create one using `python -m venv .venv` and activate it before installing.

---

## Verify Your Installation

Run the following script to confirm that BORES is installed correctly and its core dependencies are available:

```python
import bores
print(f"BORES version: {bores.__version__}")
print(f"Default precision: {bores.get_dtype()}")
```

Expected output:

```
BORES version: 0.1.0
Default precision: <class 'numpy.float32'>
```

If you see an `ImportError`, double-check that you installed BORES in the correct Python environment and that all dependencies resolved successfully.

---

## Optional Dependencies

BORES includes several optional packages that extend its capabilities. These are installed by default with the standard installation, but are worth knowing about if you are working in a minimal environment.

### Thermodynamics - CoolProp and thermo

BORES uses [CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org/) and [thermo](https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo) for advanced fluid property calculations, particularly when computing gas properties from first principles. These packages enable accurate PVT calculations for non-standard gases like CO2 or nitrogen.

```bash
pip install coolprop thermo
```

### Visualization - Plotly and Trame

The visualization module relies on [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for generating charts and 3D renders, along with [Kaleido](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/kaleido) for static image export and [Trame](https://kitware.github.io/trame/) for interactive 3D volume visualization in web browsers.

```bash
pip install plotly kaleido trame
```

### Storage - HDF5 and Zarr

BORES supports multiple storage backends for saving and loading simulation results. [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) provides HDF5 support, while [zarr](https://zarr.dev/) enables chunked, compressed array storage suitable for large simulations.

```bash
pip install h5py zarr
```

## Troubleshooting

### Numba compilation errors

Numba compiles Python functions to machine code on first use. If you encounter compilation errors, try the following:

1. **Update Numba**: Ensure you have numba >= 0.63.0 installed.
2. **Clear the cache**: Delete Numba's cache directory, typically found at `__pycache__` folders containing `.nbi` and `.nbc` files.
3. **Check your compiler**: Run `numba -s` to print system information and verify that a compatible C compiler is detected.

!!! note "First-run latency"

    The first time you import BORES or run a simulation, Numba compiles several cached functions. This may take 10-30 seconds. Subsequent runs will be much faster because compiled code is cached to disk.

### Missing BLAS/LAPACK libraries

scipy and numpy depend on optimized linear algebra libraries. On Linux, if you see errors about missing BLAS or LAPACK:

=== "Ubuntu / Debian"

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev
    ```

=== "Fedora / RHEL"

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install openblas-devel lapack-devel
    ```

=== "macOS"

    macOS ships with the Accelerate framework, which provides BLAS/LAPACK. No additional installation is needed.

=== "Windows"

    The numpy and scipy wheels on PyPI bundle their own BLAS/LAPACK (OpenBLAS). No additional installation is typically required. If you installed via `uv` on x86_64, MKL-optimized versions are used automatically.

### HDF5 build failures

If `h5py` fails to install, it may be because the HDF5 C library is not available on your system:

=== "Ubuntu / Debian"

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    brew install hdf5
    ```

=== "Windows"

    Pre-built wheels for h5py are available on PyPI and should install without issues. If you encounter problems, try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`.

## Platform Notes

### Linux

Linux is the primary development and testing platform for BORES. All features, including MKL-optimized linear algebra on x86_64, work out of the box with the standard installation.

### macOS

BORES works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. On Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4), Numba uses the ARM64 backend, which is fully supported. The Accelerate framework provides optimized BLAS/LAPACK.

### Windows

BORES is supported on Windows 10 and later. If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the Linux installation instructions apply. Native Windows installation works with both `uv` and `pip`.

!!! info "MKL Optimization"

    On x86_64 Linux and Windows, BORES is configured to use Intel MKL-optimized versions of numpy and scipy when installed via `uv`. This provides significant performance improvements for linear algebra operations, which are central to reservoir simulation. macOS and non-x86 architectures use standard OpenBLAS builds.

## Next Steps

With BORES installed, head to the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to build and run your first simulation.
