# User Guide

The User Guide provides detailed documentation for every major subsystem in BORES. Each page covers one topic in depth, with working code examples, parameter references, and practical guidance.

!!! tip "Where to Start"

    If you completed the [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md), start with the sections most relevant to your current project. The sections on wells, relative permeability, and simulation controls are the most commonly referenced.
