    Build three-phase saturation grids from fluid contact depths and reservoir properties.

    Creates physically realistic water, oil, and gas saturation distributions based on:
    - Fluid contact depths (gas-oil contact, oil-water contact)
    - Residual saturations appropriate to each zone
    - Optional capillary transition zones for smooth saturation gradients

    This function properly accounts for the fact that residual oil saturation depends
    on the displacing fluid:
    - **Gas cap zone**: Uses Sor_gas (typically 0.10-0.25) - gas displaces oil efficiently
    - **Water zone**: Uses Sor_water (typically 0.20-0.35) - water leaves more residual oil
    - **Oil zone**: Contains mobile oil with connate water and residual gas

    ### Transition Zone Physics

    The optional transition zones mimic capillary pressure effects without explicit
    capillary pressure calculations. Saturation blending uses a power-law profile:

    ```LaTex
    $$w(z) = \left(\frac{z - z_{top}}{h_{transition}}\right)^{n}$$
    ```

    Where:
    - $w$ = blending weight (0 at top, 1 at bottom)
    - $z$ = depth within transition zone
    - $h_{transition}$ = transition zone thickness
    - $n$ = curvature exponent (controls profile shape)

    **Curvature exponent effects:**
    - n < 1: Sharper transition (approaching sharp contact)
    - n = 1: Linear interpolation
    - n = 2: Smooth, S-curved transition (recommended, realistic)
    - n > 3: Very gradual transition (may be unrealistic)

    ### Typical Parameter Values

    **Water-wet sandstone reservoir:**
    - Swc = 0.20-0.30 (connate water saturation)
    - Sor_water = 0.25-0.35 (residual oil to water displacement)
    - Sor_gas = 0.10-0.20 (residual oil to gas displacement)
    - Sgr = 0.03-0.08 (residual gas saturation)
    - GOC-OWC separation = 50-500 ft (typical oil column)
    - Transition thickness = 5-20 ft (if used)

    **Oil-wet carbonate reservoir:**
    - Swc = 0.15-0.25 (lower connate water)
    - Sor_water = 0.35-0.45 (higher residual oil)
    - Sor_gas = 0.15-0.30 (higher residual oil to gas)
    - Sgr = 0.05-0.10 (residual gas)

    :param depth_grid: Grid of cell-center depths (ft). Depth increases downward,
        where k=0 is the shallowest (top) layer and k=-1 is the deepest (bottom) layer.
        Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param gas_oil_contact: Gas-oil contact depth (ft). Cells at depths less than this
        value are in the gas cap. Must be less than oil_water_contact.
    :param oil_water_contact: Oil-water contact depth (ft). Cells at depths greater than
        or equal to this value are in the water zone. Must be greater than gas_oil_contact.
    :param connate_water_saturation_grid: Connate (irreducible) water saturation for each
        cell (fraction, 0-1). This is the minimum water saturation that remains in the
        pore space even in the presence of hydrocarbons. Typical: 0.15-0.30.
        Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param residual_oil_saturation_water_grid: Residual oil saturation when oil is
        displaced by water (fraction, 0-1). This is the oil that remains trapped after
        water imbibition. Higher in oil-wet systems. Typical: 0.20-0.35 (water-wet),
        0.35-0.45 (oil-wet). Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param residual_oil_saturation_gas_grid: Residual oil saturation when oil is
        displaced by gas (fraction, 0-1). This is the oil that remains trapped after
        gas drainage. Typically lower than Sor_water due to favorable mobility ratio
        and wettability. Typical: 0.10-0.25. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param residual_gas_saturation_grid: Residual (trapped) gas saturation in the oil
        zone (fraction, 0-1). This is solution gas that has come out of solution but
        cannot flow. Typical: 0.03-0.08. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param porosity_grid: Porosity for each cell (fraction, 0-1). Used to identify
        active cells: cells with porosity <= 0 or NaN are considered inactive and
        set to zero saturation for all phases. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param use_transition_zones: If True, create smooth capillary-like transitions at
        fluid contacts. If False, use sharp (discontinuous) contacts. Default: False.
    :param gas_oil_transition_thickness: Thickness of the gas-oil transition zone (ft).
        The transition is centered on the GOC and extends ±thickness/2 around it.
        Only used if use_transition_zones=True. Typical: 5-20 ft. Default: 5.0.
    :param oil_water_transition_thickness: Thickness of the oil-water transition zone (ft).
        The transition is centered on the OWC and extends ±thickness/2 around it.
        Only used if use_transition_zones=True. Typical: 5-20 ft. Default: 5.0.
    :param transition_curvature_exponent: Power-law exponent controlling the shape of
        saturation gradients in transition zones (dimensionless). Higher values produce
        smoother, more realistic S-curves. Typical: 1.5-3.0. Default: 2.0.
        Only used if use_transition_zones=True.

    :return: Tuple of (water_saturation, oil_saturation, gas_saturation) grids, each
        with shape (nx, ny, nz). All three saturations sum to exactly 1.0 in active cells
        (where porosity > 0) and are 0.0 in inactive cells.

    :raises ValidationError: If inputs are invalid:
        - GOC >= OWC (contacts in wrong order)
        - Array shapes don't match
        - Saturation values outside [0, 1]
        - Physically impossible combinations (e.g., Swc + Sor > 1.0)
        - Transition zones overlap
        - Transition parameters are non-positive

    :warns UserWarning: If potentially problematic but not invalid:
        - Sor_gas > Sor_water (unusual wettability)

    )
    ```

    Notes:
        - Depth increases downward: smaller depth = shallower (top), larger depth = deeper (bottom)
        - Gas cap: depth < GOC (shallowest zone, uses Sor_gas)
        - Oil zone: GOC ≤ depth < OWC (middle zone, uses Sgr)
        - Water zone: depth ≥ OWC (deepest zone, uses Sor_water)
        - Inactive cells (porosity ≤ 0 or NaN) have zero saturation for all phases
        - All saturations are normalized to sum to exactly 1.0 in active cells
        - For heterogeneous reservoirs, provide spatially varying property grids
        - Transition zones should not overlap: ensure (OWC - OWC) > (h_go + h_ow)/2

    Build saturations with smooth capillary transition zones at fluid contacts.

    Creates five distinct zones with gradual saturation changes in transition regions.
    Uses appropriate residual oil saturations based on the displacing fluid:
    - Gas cap uses Sor_gas
    - Water zone uses Sor_water
    - Transition zones blend between appropriate end-members

    **Gas Cap Zone (depth < GOC - gas_oil_transition_thickness/2):**
        Pure gas zone where gas has displaced oil:
        - Sg = 1.0 - Sor_gas - Swc, So = Sor_gas, Sw = Swc

    **Gas-Oil Transition Zone (GOC - gas_oil_transition_thickness/2 <= depth <= GOC + gas_oil_transition_thickness/2):**
        Smooth transition from gas-dominated to oil-dominated:
        - Uses power-law weighting: w = ((depth - goc_top) / gas_oil_transition_thickness)^exponent
        - Gas saturation decreases from (1 - Sor_gas - Swc) to Sgr
        - Oil saturation increases from Sor_gas to (1 - Swc - Sgr)
        - Water saturation remains at Swc

    **Oil Zone (GOC + gas_oil_transition_thickness/2 < depth < OWC - oil_water_transition_thickness/2):**
        Pure oil zone with original accumulation:
        - So = 1.0 - Swc - Sgr, Sw = Swc, Sg = Sgr

    **Oil-Water Transition Zone (OWC - oil_water_transition_thickness/2 <= depth <= OWC + oil_water_transition_thickness/2):**
        Smooth transition from oil-dominated to water-dominated:
        - Uses power-law weighting: w = ((depth - owc_top) / oil_water_transition_thickness)^exponent
        - Water saturation increases from Swc to (1 - Sor_water)
        - Oil saturation decreases from (1 - Swc - Sgr) to Sor_water
        - Gas saturation decreases from Sgr to 0

    **Water Zone (depth > OWC + oil_water_transition_thickness/2):**
        Pure water zone where water has displaced oil:
        - Sw = 1.0 - Sor_water, So = Sor_water, Sg = 0.0

    The transition curvature exponent controls the shape of the saturation profile:
    - exponent < 1: More abrupt change (approaching sharp contact)
    - exponent = 1: Linear interpolation
    - exponent > 1: Smoother, S-curved transition (more realistic capillary pressure effect)
