    # GAS PROPERTIES
    - Computes gas gravity from density.
    - Uses gas gravity to derive molecular weight.
    - Computes gas z-factor (compressibility factor) from pressure, temperature, and gas gravity.
    - Updates:
        - Formation volume factor (Bg)
        - Compressibility (Cg)
        - Density (ρg)
        - Viscosity (μg)

    # WATER PROPERTIES
    - Computes gas solubility in water (Rs_w) based on salinity, pressure, and temperature.
    - Determines water bubble point pressure from solubility and salinity.
    - Computes gas-free water FVF (for use in density calculation).
    - Updates:
        - Water compressibility (Cw) considering dissolved gas
        - Water FVF (Bw)
        - Water density (ρw)
        - Water viscosity (μw)

    # OIL PROPERTIES
    - Computes oil specific gravity and API gravity from base density.
    - Recalculates bubble point pressure (Pb) using API, temperature, and gas gravity.
    - Determines GOR:
        - If current pressure < Pb: compute GOR using Vazquez-Beggs correlation.
        - If current pressure ≥ Pb: GOR = GOR at Pb (Rs = Rs_b).
    - Computes:
        - Oil formation volume factor (Bo) using pressure, Pb, GOR, and gravity.
        - Oil compressibility (Co) using updated GOR and Pb.
        - Oil density (ρo) using GOR and Bo.
        - Oil viscosity (μo) using Rs, Pb, and API.

    :param pvt_tables: PVT table for property lookups (if None, correlations are used).
    :param freeze_saturation_pressure: If True, keeps oil bubble point pressure (Pb)
        constant at its current value throughout the simulation. This is appropriate for:
        - Natural depletion with no compositional changes
        - Waterflooding where oil composition remains constant
        - Simplified black-oil models without compositional tracking
        If False (default), Pb is recomputed each timestep based on current solution GOR.

        **Properties affected when Pb is frozen:**
        - Bubble point pressure (Pb) - directly frozen
        - Solution GOR (Rs) - computed using frozen Pb as reference
        - Oil FVF (Bo) - uses frozen Pb for undersaturated calculations
        - Oil compressibility (Co) - switches at frozen Pb

    Applies solution gas liberation (or re-dissolution) to saturations based on
    changes in the solution gas-to-oil ratio (Rs) and gas solubility in water (Rsw)
    from the PVT update.

    When pressure drops below the bubble point, Rs and Rsw decrease and dissolved gas
    comes out of solution as free gas. When pressure rises and free gas is present,
    gas can re-dissolve into oil and water.

    Physics:
        - Oil shrinks when Rs decreases: So_new = So_old * Bo_new / Bo_old
        - Water shrinks when Rsw decreases: Sw_new = Sw_old * Bw_new / Bw_old
        - Gas appears from oil: dSg_oil = (Rs_old - Rs_new) * So_old * [Bg_new / (Bo_old * bbl_to_ft3)]
        - Gas appears from water: dSg_water = (Rsw_old - Rsw_new) * Sw_old * [Bg_new / (Bw_old * bbl_to_ft3)]
        - Re-dissolution is capped at available free gas
        - Rs and Rsw are corrected if the PVT update assumed more gas could dissolve than exists
