    A rough guide by grid size:

    - < 10,000 cells  → leave as `None`
    - 10,000-50,000   → marginal benefit, profile before committing
    - 50,000-200,000  → noticeable benefit, 3 workers recommended
    - > 200,000       → clearly beneficial, assembly cost approaches solve cost

    **Lifecycle**

    The pool is not created or shut down by `Config`. The caller is responsible
    for managing its lifetime. The recommended pattern is to create the pool
    once for the entire simulation run using `new_task_pool()` and pass it in
    at `Config` construction time:

    ```python
    with new_task_pool(concurrency=3) as pool:
        config = Config(..., task_pool=pool)
        for state in run(model, config):
            process(state)
    # Pool shuts down cleanly here
    ```

    Do not share a pool between concurrent simulation runs unless the pool has
    sufficient workers to service both simultaneously.

    """
    Context manager that creates a `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent
    simulation assembly and shuts it down cleanly on exit.

    Intended as the standard way to supply a `task_pool` to `Config`.
    The pool is created once, used for the entire simulation run, and
    gracefully shut down (waiting for any in-flight work to complete)
    when the `with` block exits - whether normally or due to an exception.

    :param concurrency: Maximum number of tasks that may run concurrently.
        If `None`, Python defaults to `min(32, os.cpu_count() + 4)`,
        which is almost always too large for simulation assembly. Pass an
        explicit value instead:

        - `3` for IMPES (pressure assembly has 3 independent stages,
          saturation assembly has 2 - 3 workers covers both without waste).
        - `2` if the machine has only 2 physical cores available to the
          process, or if memory bandwidth is the bottleneck rather than
          compute.
        - Higher values provide no additional benefit for the current
          assembly design, which submits at most 3 tasks per solver call.

    :yields: The configured `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

    Example: Standard IMPES run with concurrent assembly:

    ```python
    from bores.config import Config, new_task_pool

    with new_task_pool(concurrency=3) as pool:
        config = Config(
            timer=timer,
            rock_fluid_tables=tables,
            task_pool=pool,
        )
        for state in run(model, config):
            process(state)
    # Pool shuts down here; all in-flight writes complete before exit
    ```

    Example: Conditional pool based on grid size:

    ```python
    cell_count = nx * ny * nz

    if cell_count > 10_000:
        with new_task_pool(concurrency=3) as pool:
            config = Config(..., task_pool=pool)
            for state in run(model, config):
                process(state)
    else:
        config = Config(...)   # no pool, sequential assembly
        for state in run(model, config):
            process(state)
    ```

    Note: Do not pass the pool to more than one `Config` instance that
    will be used concurrently. Each simulation run submits up to 3 tasks
    per solver call; two concurrent runs would require 6 workers to avoid
    queuing, and the assembly functions are not designed for that usage.
