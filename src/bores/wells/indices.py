    Compute well indices for all perforated cells across all injection and production wells.

    Well indices depend only on static geometric and rock properties (permeability, cell
    dimensions, skin factor, wellbore radius, and boundary conditions), so they are
    invariant across time steps and can be computed once at simulation startup.

    The resulting cache eliminates redundant well index computations from the inner
    time-step loop in the pressure and saturation solvers.

    :param wells: `Wells` container holding all injection and production wells.
    :param thickness_grid: Padded 3D grid of cell thicknesses (ft). Must include ghost cells.
    :param absolute_permeability: Padded absolute permeability object with x, y, z component grids (mD).
    :param boundary_conditions: Model boundary conditions. Used to apply no-flow boundary
        corrections to the Peaceman effective drainage radius for wells at grid boundaries.
    :param cell_size_x: Cell size in the x-direction (ft).
    :param cell_size_y: Cell size in the y-direction (ft).
    :param cell_count_x: Total number of cells in the x-direction, including ghost cells.
    :param cell_count_y: Total number of cells in the y-direction, including ghost cells.
    :param cell_count_z: Total number of cells in the z-direction, including ghost cells.
    :param pad_width: Number of ghost cells used for grid padding. Well coordinates are
        offset by this amount when indexing into padded grids. Defaults to 1.
