    Compute net volumetric flux into each cell from all 6 neighbours (excluding wells).

    For each cell, all six face neighbours are checked:

    1. **Interior neighbour** (indices in [0, cell_count_*)):
       Full multi-phase flux via `compute_flux_from_neighbour` — pressure, capillary,
       and gravity contributions using harmonic face mobilities from both cells.

    2. **Out-of-bounds neighbour** — boundary face. Convert out-of-bounds indices
       to padded ghost-cell coordinates (i+1, j+1, k+1) and look up directly in
       the boundary grids:

       a. **Dirichlet** (pressure value is not NaN in pressure_boundaries):
          Known boundary pressure p_bc. One-sided flux using only the interior
          cell's total mobility (no harmonic mean — ghost has no real mobility)
          and only the oil pressure difference (ghost has no capillary or gravity
          properties):

              flux = T_geo * lambda_total[i,j,k] * md_per_cp * (p_bc - p_cell)

       b. **Neumann** (pressure value is NaN in pressure_boundaries):
          Known boundary flux q_bc in ft³/day from flux_boundaries. Added directly
          to the cell's net flux with no further modification.

Explicit finite difference formulation for pressure diffusion in a 3D reservoir
(slightly compressible three-phase fluid):

The governing equation is the 3D linear-flow diffusivity equation:

    ∂p/∂t * (φ·c_t) * V = ∇ · (λ_t · ∇Φ) * A + q * V

where:
    - ∂p/∂t * (φ·c_t) * V is the accumulation term (ft³/day)
    - ∇ · (λ_t · ∇Φ) * A is the diffusion term including gravity and capillary effects
    - q * V is the source/sink term (injection/production) (ft³/day)

    λ_t = total mobility = Σ_phases (k · kr_phase / μ_phase)  (ft²/psi·day)
    Φ_phase = phase potential = P_phase + ρ_phase · (g/gc) · Δz / 144  (psi)

    Phase pressures:
        P_water = P_oil - P_cow  (capillary correction)
        P_gas   = P_oil + P_cgo  (capillary correction)

Assumptions:
    - Slightly compressible fluids (properties frozen at current time level)
    - Cartesian grid (structured)
    - Mobility and density are evaluated at old time level (explicit)

The diffusion term is expanded as:

    ∇ · (λ_t · ∇Φ) = ∂/∂x (λ_t · ∂Φ/∂x) + ∂/∂y (λ_t · ∂Φ/∂y) + ∂/∂z (λ_t · ∂Φ/∂z)

    The total flux across each face sums phase contributions:
        q_face = Σ_phases [λ_phase · (ΔP_phase + ρ_phase · g/gc · Δelevation / 144)]

Explicit Discretization (Forward Euler in time, central difference in space):

    ∂p/∂t ≈ (pⁿ⁺¹_ijk - pⁿ_ijk) / Δt

    ∂/∂x (λ·∂Φ/∂x) ≈ (λ_{i+½}·Φⁿ_{i+1} - λ_{i+½}·Φⁿ_i - λ_{i-½}·Φⁿ_i + λ_{i-½}·Φⁿ_{i-1}) / Δx²

Final explicit update formula:

    pⁿ⁺¹_ijk = pⁿ_ijk + (Δt / (φ·c_t·V)) * [
        Σ_neighbours [λ_harmonic · (ΔP + capillary + gravity) · A_face / ΔL] + q_{i,j,k} * V
    ]

    Gravity potential at each face:
        gravity_potential_phase = harmonic_ρ_phase · (g/gc) · Δelevation / 144   (psi)

Where:
    - Δt is time step (s)
    - Δx, Δy, Δz are cell dimensions (ft)
    - A_x = Δy · h_face; A_y = Δx · h_face; A_z = Δx · Δy (ft²)
    - V = Δx · Δy · Δz (ft³)
    - h_face = harmonic mean of adjacent cell thicknesses (ft)
    - λ_{i±½,...} = harmonic average of total mobility between adjacent cells
    - q_{i,j,k} = well injection/production rate (ft³/day)

Stability Condition:
    Explicit scheme is conditionally stable. The 3D diffusion CFL criterion requires:
    Δt ≤ min( (φ·c_t·V) / (2 · λ_max · (A_x/Δx + A_y/Δy + A_z/Δz)) )

Notes:
    - Harmonic averaging is used for both λ and ρ at cell interfaces.
    - Gravity and capillary effects are included in the phase potential difference.
    - Volume-normalized source/sink terms only affect the cell where the well is located.
