    Compute net per-phase volumetric flux into each cell from all 6 neighbours (excluding wells).

    For each cell, all six face neighbours are checked:

    1. **Interior neighbour** (indices in [0, cell_count_*)):
       Full upwind per-phase flux via `compute_fluxes_from_neighbour` — pressure,
       capillary, and gravity contributions using upwind mobilities from both cells.

    2. **Out-of-bounds neighbour** — boundary face. Convert out-of-bounds indices
       to padded ghost-cell coordinates (i+1, j+1, k+1) and look up directly in
       the boundary grids:

       a. **Dirichlet** (pressure value is not NaN in pressure_boundaries):
          Known boundary pressure p_bc. One-sided flux per phase using only the
          interior cell's individual phase mobility (no upwinding — ghost has no
          real mobility) and only the oil pressure difference (ghost has no
          capillary or gravity properties). No capillary correction is applied
          since the ghost has no saturation state:

              water_flux = T_geo * λ_w[i,j,k] * md_per_cp * (p_bc - p_cell)
              oil_flux   = T_geo * λ_o[i,j,k] * md_per_cp * (p_bc - p_cell)
              gas_flux   = T_geo * λ_g[i,j,k] * md_per_cp * (p_bc - p_cell)

       b. **Neumann** (pressure value is NaN in pressure_boundaries):
          Known boundary flux flux_boundary in ft³/day from flux_boundaries. The total flux
          is split across phases in proportion to their mobility fractions at the
          interior cell, then added directly to each phase's net flux. If total
          mobility is zero, the flux is skipped (no flow).

        Ghost-cell region indexed by [i+1, j+1, k+1] for out-of-bounds cell (i, j, k).

    Apply saturation updates with CFL criteria checking and PVT volume correction.

    In IMPES, the pressure equation includes compressibility so the saturation
    transport must too. If not, we would creates a volume balance mismatch where So + Sw + Sg
    drifts from 1.0 over time. The PVT correction accounts for fluid expansion /
    contraction and pore volume change due to the pressure change:

        ΔSα_pvt = Sα x (cα + cf) x (-ΔP)

    This ensures each phase's saturation properly reflects both transport and
    pressure-driven volume changes, maintaining So + Sw + Sg ≈ 1.0 without
    artificial proportional normalization that would inflate immobile phases.

"""
Explicit finite difference formulation for saturation transport in a 3D reservoir
(immiscible three-phase flow: oil, water, and gas with slightly compressible fluids):

The governing equation for saturation evolution is conservation of mass per phase:

    ∂S_x/∂t * (φ * V_cell) = Σ_faces [F_x_face] + q_x * V_cell

Where:
    ∂S_x/∂t * φ * V_cell = Accumulation term (change in phase volume) (ft³/day)
    Σ_faces [F_x_face] = Net advective flux from all 6 neighbours (ft³/day)
    q_x * V_cell = Source/sink term for the phase (injection/production) (ft³/day)

Phase Flux Computation (per-phase Darcy velocity, not fractional flow):

    Each phase has its own Darcy velocity driven by its own potential gradient:

    v_x_phase = λ_phase · ∂Φ_phase/∂dir / ΔL_dir    (ft/day)
    F_x_face = v_x_phase · A_face                      (ft³/day)

    where:
    λ_phase = k · kr_phase(S_upwind) / μ_phase         (ft²/psi·day)
    Φ_phase = P_phase + ρ_phase · (g/gc) · Δelevation / 144   (psi)

    Phase pressures include capillary corrections:
        P_water = P_oil - P_cow
        P_gas   = P_oil + P_cgo

    This per-phase formulation correctly handles capillary-driven counter-current flow,
    where different phases can flow in opposite directions at the same face.

Upwind Selection:

    Two-stage upwinding:
    1. Density upwinding: ρ_upwind selected based on pressure difference sign
       (used in gravity potential computation)
    2. Mobility upwinding: λ_upwind selected based on total phase potential sign
       (used in Darcy velocity computation)

    Convention: positive flux = flow from neighbour into current cell.

Gravity:

    gravity_potential_phase = ρ_upwind_phase · (g/gc) · Δelevation / 144   (psi)

    where:
    g/gc = 32.174 / 32.174 = 1.0 (dimensionless in consistent imperial units)
    Δelevation = elevation_neighbour - elevation_current (ft)
    144 converts lbf/ft² to psi

    Gravity drives lighter phases (gas) upward and heavier phases (water, oil) downward.

Discretization:

Time: Forward Euler
    ∂S/∂t ≈ (Sⁿ⁺¹_ijk - Sⁿ_ijk) / Δt

Space: First-order upwind scheme

    Sⁿ⁺¹_ijk = Sⁿ_ijk + Δt / (φ · V_cell) · [
        Σ_faces [F_phase_face] + q_phase_ijk · V_cell
    ]

Variables:
    Sⁿ_ijk = saturation at cell (i,j,k) at time step n
    Sⁿ⁺¹_ijk = updated saturation
    φ = porosity
    Δx, Δy = cell dimensions in x, y (ft)
    h_face = harmonic mean of adjacent cell thicknesses (ft)
    A_x = Δy · h_face; A_y = Δx · h_face; A_z = Δx · Δy (face areas, ft²)
    ΔL = flow length between cell centres (ft)
    q_phase_ijk = phase well rate (ft³/day)

Assumptions:
- Darcy flow
- No dispersion or diffusion (purely advective; miscible version adds optional diffusion)
- Saturation-dependent relative permeability (Corey, Brooks-Corey, LET, etc.)
- Time step satisfies CFL condition
- Pressure field is computed before solving saturation (IMPES splitting)

Stability (CFL) condition:

    max(|v_x|/Δx + |v_y|/Δy + |v_z|/Δz) · Δt / φ ≤ 1

Notes:
- Pressure field must be computed before solving saturation.
- Upwind selection is based on phase potential, not pressure alone.
- All three phase transport equations (water, oil, gas) are solved independently.
  A residual volume balance correction is applied to oil to enforce So + Sw + Sg = 1.
  (This differs from the implicit saturation solver, which solves only Sw and Sg
  and derives So = 1 - Sw - Sg from the constraint.)
