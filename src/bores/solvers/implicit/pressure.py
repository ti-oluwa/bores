    Compute face flux contributions for the implicit pressure matrix.

    The grid passed in is the real (unpadded) grid — shape (cell_count_x, cell_count_y,
    cell_count_z) with no ghost-cell layers. Boundary conditions are supplied via two
    dicts keyed on ghost-cell 1D indices computed *as if* the grid were padded by one
    layer on each side (i.e. using cell_count_* + 2 for the padded dimensions).

    For every interior cell we examine its six face neighbours:
        east   = (i+1, j,   k  )
        west   = (i-1, j,   k  )
        south  = (i,   j+1, k  )
        north  = (i,   j-1, k  )
        bottom = (i,   j,   k+1)
        top    = (i,   j,   k-1)

    For each face we classify the neighbour:

    1. **Interior neighbour** (indices in [0, cell_count_*)):
       Standard interior-interior pair — symmetric off-diagonal entries and
       both diagonal contributions added. The RHS gets equal and opposite
       capillary + gravity terms.

    2. **Out-of-bounds neighbour** — boundary face. Convert the out-of-bounds
       indices to a ghost-cell 1D index using the *padded* grid dimensions
       (cell_count_* + 2, with a +1 offset on each axis so that valid cell (0,0,0)
       maps to padded index (1,1,1)):

           ghost_1d = to_1D_index(
               i=i_neighbour + 1,
               j=j_neighbour + 1,
               k=k_neighbour + 1,
               cell_count_x=cell_count_x + 2,
               cell_count_y=cell_count_y + 2,
               cell_count_z=cell_count_z + 2,
           )

       Then look it up:

       a. **Dirichlet** (ghost_1d in pressure_boundaries):
          Known boundary pressure p_bc.
          - diagonal += T_face              (A[cell, cell] += T)
          - rhs      += T_face * p_bc       (known pressure drives flow)
          - rhs      += capillary_flux + gravity_flux          (non-pressure driving forces)
          No off-diagonal entry (neighbour is not a free unknown).

       b. **Neumann** (ghost_1d in flux_boundaries):
          Known boundary flux q_bc in ft³/day already.
          - rhs += q_bc                     (flux applied directly to RHS)
          No diagonal or off-diagonal entry.

    For each face shared between `this_cell` and `neighbour_cell` (interior pair):

        transmissibility  - total fluid mobility scaled by face geometry (ft³/psi·day)
        rhs_term          - capillary + gravity pseudo-flux across the face (ft³/day)

    These produce contributions to the linear system A·p = b:

        Sparse off-diagonal (interior-interior only):
            A[this_cell, neighbour_cell] -= transmissibility
            A[neighbour_cell, this_cell] -= transmissibility   (matrix is symmetric)

        Diagonal (resistance term, keeps matrix diagonally dominant):
            A[this_cell,      this_cell]      += transmissibility
            A[neighbour_cell, neighbour_cell] += transmissibility

        RHS (non-pressure driving forces — capillary and gravity):
            b[this_cell]      += rhs_term
            b[neighbour_cell] -= rhs_term    (equal and opposite)

    **Race-condition avoidance**

    The diagonal and RHS contributions are scatter-adds: processing the face
    between cells i and j updates both i and j. Running this naively with prange
    would cause two threads to race on those shared diagonal/RHS slots.

    Strategy:
        1. `prange` over i-slices. Each thread writes exclusively into its own
           row of the 2D thread-local buffers (indexed by [ii, local_slot]).
           Zero shared writes and zero race conditions.

        2. After the parallel loop, a single sequential pass over the 2D buffers
           packs the sparse arrays and scatter-adds into `diagonal_additions` and
           `rhs_additions` simultaneously. This is safe because it is single-threaded.

    This avoids any intermediate flat arrays for diagonal/RHS, saving
    two full-size allocations and an extra scan.

    Memory layout note:
        The 2D thread buffers are shaped (cell_count_x, max_entries_per_i_slice).
        Accessing `[ii, local_slot]` is row-major and therefore cache-friendly
        since `local_slot` is the inner (fast-moving) index.

"""
Implicit finite difference formulation for pressure diffusion in a 3D reservoir
(slightly compressible fluid):

The governing equation for pressure evolution is the linear-flow diffusivity equation:

    ∂p/∂t * (φ·c_t) * V = ∇·(λ·∇p) * A + q * V

Where:
    ∂p/∂t * (φ·c_t) * V — Accumulation term
    ∇·(λ·∇p) * A — Diffusion term (Darcy's law)
    q * V — Source/sink term

Assumptions:
    - Constant porosity (φ), compressibility (c_t), and density (ρ)
    - No reaction or advection terms (pressure-only evolution)
    - Capillary effects optional, appear in source term via pressure corrections

Diffusion term expanded in 3D:

    ∇·(λ·∇p) = ∂/∂x(λ·∂p/∂x) + ∂/∂y(λ·∂p/∂y) + ∂/∂z(λ·∂p/∂z)

Discretization:

Using Backward Euler in time:

    ∂p/∂t ≈ (pⁿ⁺¹_ijk - pⁿ_ijk) / Δt

Using central differences in space:

    ∂/∂x(λ·∂p/∂x) ≈ [λ_{i+½,j,k}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i+1,j,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i⁻½,j,k}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i⁻1,j,k})] / Δx²
    ∂/∂y(λ·∂p/∂y) ≈ [λ_{i,j+½,k}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j+1,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i,j⁻½,k}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j⁻1,k})] / Δy²
    ∂/∂z(λ·∂p/∂z) ≈ [λ_{i,j,k+½}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k+1} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i,j,k⁻½}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k⁻1})] / Δz²

Putting it all together:

    (pⁿ⁺¹_ijk - pⁿ_ijk) * (φ·c_t·V) / Δt =
        A/Δx · [λ_{i+½,j,k}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i+1,j,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i⁻½,j,k}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i⁻1,j,k})] +
        A/Δy · [λ_{i,j+½,k}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j+1,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i,j⁻½,k}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j⁻1,k})] +
        A/Δz · [λ_{i,j,k+½}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k+1} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i,j,k⁻½}·(pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k} - pⁿ⁺¹_{i,j,k⁻1})] +
        qⁿ⁺¹_ijk * V

Matrix form:

Let:
    Tx⁺ = λ_{i+½,j,k}·A / Δx
    Tx⁻ = λ_{i⁻½,j,k}·A / Δx
    Ty⁺ = λ_{i,j+½,k}·A / Δy
    Ty⁻ = λ_{i,j⁻½,k}·A / Δy
    Tz⁺ = λ_{i,j,k+½}·A / Δz
    Tz⁻ = λ_{i,j,k⁻½}·A / Δz
    β   = φ·c_t·V / Δt

Then:

    A_{ijk,ijk}     = β + Tx⁺ + Tx⁻ + Ty⁺ + Ty⁻ + Tz⁺ + Tz⁻
    A_{ijk,i+1jk}   = -Tx⁺
    A_{ijk,i-1jk}   = -Tx⁻
    A_{ijk,ij+1k}   = -Ty⁺

RHS vector: (Contains terms that actually drive flow)

    b_{ijk} = (β * pⁿ_{ijk}) + (q_{ijk} * V) + Total Capillary Driven Flow + Gravity Driven Flow/Segregation

Capillary pressure driven flow term (if multiphase):

    total_capillary_flow = sum of directional contributions:
        For each direction:
            [(λ_w * ∇P_cow) + (λ_g * ∇P_cgo)] * A / (Δx, Δy, Δz)

Gravity driven segregation (in effect in all directions; dominant in z, non-zero in x/y for dipping reservoirs):

    For each face between cell and neighbour:

    gravity_potential_phase = (harmonic_ρ_phase * g/gc * ∆elevation) / 144   [psi]

    total_gravity_flow = (
            [λ_w * (harmonic_ρ_w * g/gc * ∆elevation) / 144]
            + [λ_o * (harmonic_ρ_o * g/gc * ∆elevation) / 144]
            + [λ_g * (harmonic_ρ_g * g/gc * ∆elevation) / 144]
    ) * A / ΔL

    Where:
    g/gc = 32.174 / 32.174 = 1.0 (dimensionless in consistent imperial units),
    ∆elevation = elevation_neighbour - elevation_current (ft),
    harmonic_ρ_w, harmonic_ρ_o, harmonic_ρ_g are harmonic mean densities at the face (lbm/ft³),
    144 converts lbf/ft² to psi.

This results in a 7-point stencil sparse matrix (in 3D) for solving A·pⁿ⁺¹ = b.

Notes:
    - Harmonic averaging is used for both λ and ρ at cell interfaces
    - Capillary pressure is optional but included via ∇P_cow and ∇P_cgo terms
    - The system is solved each time step to advance pressure implicitly
