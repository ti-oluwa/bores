    Compute face flux contributions for the implicit pressure matrix.

    The grid passed in is the real (unpadded) grid — shape (cell_count_x, cell_count_y,
    cell_count_z) with no ghost-cell layers. Boundary conditions are supplied via two
    dicts keyed on ghost-cell 1D indices computed *as if* the grid were padded by one
    layer on each side (i.e. using cell_count_* + 2 for the padded dimensions).

    For every interior cell we examine its six face neighbours:
        east   = (i+1, j,   k  )
        west   = (i-1, j,   k  )
        south  = (i,   j+1, k  )
        north  = (i,   j-1, k  )
        bottom = (i,   j,   k+1)
        top    = (i,   j,   k-1)

    For each face we classify the neighbour:

    1. **Interior neighbour** (indices in [0, cell_count_*)):
       Standard interior-interior pair — symmetric off-diagonal entries and
       both diagonal contributions added. The RHS gets equal and opposite
       capillary + gravity terms.

    2. **Out-of-bounds neighbour** — boundary face. Convert the out-of-bounds
       indices to a ghost-cell 1D index using the *padded* grid dimensions
       (cell_count_* + 2, with a +1 offset on each axis so that valid cell (0,0,0)
       maps to padded index (1,1,1)):

           ghost_1d = to_1D_index(
               i=i_neighbour + 1,
               j=j_neighbour + 1,
               k=k_neighbour + 1,
               cell_count_x=cell_count_x + 2,
               cell_count_y=cell_count_y + 2,
               cell_count_z=cell_count_z + 2,
           )

       Then look it up:

       a. **Dirichlet** (ghost_1d in pressure_boundaries):
          Known boundary pressure p_bc.
          - diagonal += T_face              (A[cell, cell] += T)
          - rhs      += T_face * p_bc       (known pressure drives flow)
          - rhs      += capillary_flux + gravity_flux          (non-pressure driving forces)
          No off-diagonal entry (neighbour is not a free unknown).

       b. **Neumann** (ghost_1d in flux_boundaries):
          Known boundary flux q_bc in ft³/day already.
          - rhs += q_bc                     (flux applied directly to RHS)
          No diagonal or off-diagonal entry.

    For each face shared between `this_cell` and `neighbour_cell` (interior pair):

        transmissibility  - total fluid mobility scaled by face geometry (ft³/psi·day)
        rhs_term          - capillary + gravity pseudo-flux across the face (ft³/day)

    These produce contributions to the linear system A·p = b:

        Sparse off-diagonal (interior-interior only):
            A[this_cell, neighbour_cell] -= transmissibility
            A[neighbour_cell, this_cell] -= transmissibility   (matrix is symmetric)

        Diagonal (resistance term, keeps matrix diagonally dominant):
            A[this_cell,      this_cell]      += transmissibility
            A[neighbour_cell, neighbour_cell] += transmissibility

        RHS (non-pressure driving forces — capillary and gravity):
            b[this_cell]      += rhs_term
            b[neighbour_cell] -= rhs_term    (equal and opposite)

    **Race-condition avoidance**

    The diagonal and RHS contributions are scatter-adds: processing the face
    between cells i and j updates both i and j. Running this naively with prange
    would cause two threads to race on those shared diagonal/RHS slots.

    Strategy:
        1. `prange` over i-slices. Each thread writes exclusively into its own
           row of the 2D thread-local buffers (indexed by [ii, local_slot]).
           Zero shared writes and zero race conditions.

        2. After the parallel loop, a single sequential pass over the 2D buffers
           packs the sparse arrays and scatter-adds into `diagonal_additions` and
           `rhs_additions` simultaneously. This is safe because it is single-threaded.

    This avoids any intermediate flat arrays for diagonal/RHS, saving
    two full-size allocations and an extra scan.

    Memory layout note:
        The 2D thread buffers are shaped (cell_count_x, max_entries_per_i_slice).
        Accessing `[ii, local_slot]` is row-major and therefore cache-friendly
        since `local_slot` is the inner (fast-moving) index.
