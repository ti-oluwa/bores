    Compute all relperm and capillary pressure derivative grids for the
    analytical Jacobian.

    Called once per Newton iteration before `assemble_analytical_jacobian`.
    The Numba Jacobian kernel cannot call Python objects, so all derivative
    evaluations must happen here.

    **Relperm derivatives**

    All nine raw partials `d kr_alpha / d S_beta` (with `beta in {Sw, So, Sg}`)
    are returned unchanged. The Jacobian kernel projects out the oil saturation
    dependence inline using `dSo/dSw = -1` and `dSo/dSg = -1`.

    **Capillary pressure derivatives — projected onto (Sw, Sg) basis**

    Capillary pressures may depend on oil saturation (e.g. a gas-oil table
    indexed by So). The constraint `So = 1 - Sw - Sg` gives
    `dSo/dSw_free = dSo/dSg_free = -1`, so the effective derivatives are:

    ```
    dPcow_dSw_eff = dPcow_dSw + dPcow_dSo * (-1)
    dPcow_dSg_eff =              dPcow_dSo * (-1)
    dPcgo_dSw_eff =              dPcgo_dSo * (-1)
    dPcgo_dSg_eff = dPcgo_dSg + dPcgo_dSo * (-1)
    ```

    These are pre-projected here so the Numba kernel receives simple scalars
    with no further chain-rule work.

    Free variables are Sw and Sg only (So = 1 - Sw - Sg is derived).
    For any phase alpha and free variable beta:

    Effective relperm derivatives (So projected out via dSo/dSw = dSo/dSg = -1)::

        dkr_alpha/dSw_eff = dkr_alpha/dSw + dkr_alpha/dSo * (-1)

    Mobility derivative (upwind cell only)::

        dF_alpha/dSbeta_up = (k_up/mu_alpha) * (dkr_alpha/dSbeta_eff_up) * delta_Phi_alpha * T

    Capillary potential derivative (both face cells)::

        dF_w/dSbeta = lambda_w_up * (-dPcow_i/dSbeta_eff) * T   when beta belongs to cell i
        dF_w/dSbeta = lambda_w_up * (+dPcow_j/dSbeta_eff) * T   when beta belongs to cell j

    Same pattern for gas with dPcgo.

    Residual convention R = accum - sum_F - wells, so dR/dS = -dF/dS for flux
    terms and +phi*V/dt for the accumulation diagonal.

    Oil relative permeability derivatives (dkro grids) are not needed by the
    water and gas residual equations directly, since the water and gas
    mobilities depend only on krw and krg respectively.  They are omitted from
    the function signature.

    Note: well derivatives are omitted (second-order correction).
