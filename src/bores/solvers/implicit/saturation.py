    Assemble the saturation Jacobian matrix using column-wise forward finite differences.

    Exploits the known 7-point stencil sparsity pattern of the residual: perturbing
    Sw or Sg at cell `(i, j, k)` can only affect the residuals of that cell and its
    six immediate face-neighbours. Only those rows are evaluated, so the cost scales
    as `O(N)` residual evaluations rather than `O(N²)`.

    All arithmetic is performed in `float64` regardless of the working precision
    (`dtype`) to avoid round-off artifacts in the finite-difference quotients.
    Perturbation is applied **in-place** on the shared float64 grids and immediately
    restored after each column evaluation, eliminating the `6N` full-grid copies
    that a copy-based approach would require.

    The perturbation sign is chosen adaptively:

    * **Forward** (`+epsilon`) by default.
    * **Backward** (`-epsilon`) when a forward step would make `So = 1 - Sw - Sg`
      negative (i.e. the cell is near the `So = 0` boundary).
    * A further safety clamp is applied when even the backward step would drive
      the perturbed variable below zero (simplex vertex case).

    :param saturation_vector: Current saturation vector of length `2N`, interleaved
        as `[Sw_0, Sg_0, Sw_1, Sg_1, ..., Sw_{N-1}, Sg_{N-1}]`.
    :param residual_base: Pre-computed residual vector at the current iterate,
        interleaved as `[Rw_0, Rg_0, ..., Rw_{N-1}, Rg_{N-1}]`. Length `2N`.
        Must be evaluated at the same saturation state as `saturation_vector`.
    :param interior_cell_count: Number of interior (non-ghost) cells `N`.
    :param cell_count_x: Total number of cells in the x-direction including ghost cells.
    :param cell_count_y: Total number of cells in the y-direction including ghost cells.
    :param cell_count_z: Total number of cells in the z-direction including ghost cells.
    :param water_saturation_grid: 3D grid of current water saturations (fraction).
        Modified in-place during Jacobian assembly and fully restored on exit.
    :param oil_saturation_grid: 3D grid of current oil saturations (fraction).
        Modified in-place during Jacobian assembly and fully restored on exit.
    :param gas_saturation_grid: 3D grid of current gas saturations (fraction).
        Modified in-place during Jacobian assembly and fully restored on exit.
    :param old_water_saturation_grid: 3D grid of water saturations at the start of
        the time step (fraction). Used in the residual accumulation term.
    :param old_gas_saturation_grid: 3D grid of gas saturations at the start of
        the time step (fraction). Used in the residual accumulation term.
    :param oil_pressure_grid: 3D grid of oil-phase pressures fixed from the implicit
        pressure solve (psi). Not modified.
    :param pressure_change_grid: 3D grid of `P_new - P_old` (psi) used for the
        PVT volume correction term in the residual.
    :param rock_properties: Rock properties container (permeability, porosity,
        residual saturations, compressibility).
    :param fluid_properties: Fluid properties container at the current pressure level
        (viscosities, FVFs, compressibilities, densities).
    :param wells: Well definitions including perforations and controls.
    :param config: Simulation configuration (relperm tables, solver settings, etc.).
    :param thickness_grid: 3D grid of cell thicknesses (ft).
    :param cell_size_x: Cell size in the x-direction (ft).
    :param cell_size_y: Cell size in the y-direction (ft).
    :param elevation_grid: 3D grid of cell centre elevations (ft).
    :param porosity_grid: 3D grid of cell porosities (fraction).
    :param time: Elapsed simulation time at the current time step (s).
    :param time_step_in_days: Current time step size (days).
    :param gravitational_constant: `g / g_c` conversion factor (lbf/lbm),
        equal to 1.0 in consistent imperial units on Earth.
    :param water_compressibility_grid: 3D grid of water compressibilities (1/psi).
    :param gas_compressibility_grid: 3D grid of gas compressibilities (1/psi).
    :param rock_compressibility: Scalar pore (rock) compressibility (1/psi).
    :param boundary_conditions: Pressure and saturation boundary conditions.
    :param injection_grid: Optional grid to accumulate injection rates by phase
        (oil, water, gas) in ft³/day. Written on each residual evaluation so the
        final state reflects the last perturbed column; callers that need
        physically meaningful rates should re-evaluate after Jacobian assembly.
        Pass `None` to skip tracking.
    :param production_grid: Optional grid to accumulate production rates by phase
        (oil, water, gas) in ft³/day. Same semantics as `injection_grid`.
        Pass `None` to skip tracking.
    :param pad_width: Number of ghost-cell layers surrounding the active grid.
        Well coordinates are offset by this amount internally.
    :param dtype: Working floating-point dtype (`np.float32` or `np.float64`).
        The finite-difference arithmetic is always performed in `float64`
        regardless of this value.
    :return: Sparse Jacobian matrix of shape `(2N, 2N)` in CSR format. Entry

    Solve the implicit saturation equations using Newton-Raphson iteration

    Pressure is fixed from the implicit pressure solve. The Newton loop
    iterates on saturation until either:
      1. The relative residual norm drops below `newton_tolerance`, OR
      2. The max saturation change per iteration drops below
         `saturation_convergence_tolerance` and the relative residual
         is below 1e-3 (i.e. the solution is effectively converged but
         the upwind scheme discontinuity prevents further residual reduction).

    The Newton update is damped so that no single cell changes saturation
