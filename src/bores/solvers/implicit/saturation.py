    Solve the implicit saturation equations using Newton-Raphson iteration

    Pressure is fixed from the implicit pressure solve. The Newton loop
    iterates on saturation until either:
      1. The relative residual norm drops below `newton_tolerance`, OR
      2. The max saturation change per iteration drops below
         `saturation_convergence_tolerance` and the relative residual
         is below 1e-3 (i.e. the solution is effectively converged but
         the upwind scheme discontinuity prevents further residual reduction).

    The Newton update is damped so that no single cell changes saturation
    by more than `max_saturation_step` per iteration. This prevents
    upwind direction flipping that causes limit-cycle oscillation.
