    fixed coefficients: `∂rho/∂S = 0` and `∂Rs/∂S = 0` exactly.

    Assemble the inter-cell flux and accumulation parts of the mass-based saturation Jacobian.

    The accumulation terms in the mass formulation differ from the volumetric formulation.
    Since densities are frozen during Newton iterations (they are functions of pressure only
    in the sequential implicit scheme), the accumulation Jacobian terms are simply scaled by
    the frozen cell density:

        dR_w/dSw_i (accumulation) = water_density_i * (phi*V_i/dt)
        dR_g/dSg_i (accumulation) = gas_density_i * (phi*V_i/dt)
        dR_g/dSw_i (accumulation) = water_density_i * alpha_Rsw_i * (phi*V_i/dt)  [from water term in gas equation]

    Note: the gas accumulation also has a contribution from So = 1 - Sw - Sg:
        M_g = gas_density*Sg + oil_density*alpha_Rs*(1-Sw-Sg) + water_density*alpha_Rsw*Sw
        dM_g/dSw = -oil_density*alpha_Rs + water_density*alpha_Rsw
        dM_g/dSg = gas_density - oil_density*alpha_Rs

    The flux Jacobian entries follow the same upwind pattern as the volumetric
    formulation, but each flux term is pre-multiplied by the upwind density
    (frozen during Newton). Since the upwind direction is determined by the
    phase potential (which depends on saturation through capillary pressure), the
    density multiplier is technically at the upwind cell. For simplicity and
    consistency with the frozen-density assumption, the density at the current cell
    is used as the scale factor — this is exact for the cell's own contribution
    and approximate (but consistent) for the neighbour's contribution.

    Boundary faces have zero Jacobian w.r.t. saturation (prescribed flux).

    Solve the mass-based implicit saturation equations using Newton-Raphson iteration.

    The residual equations conserve fluid mass rather than reservoir-condition volume.
    For water:

        R_w = (phi*V/dt) * (current_water_density*Sw_new - old_water_density*Sw_old)
              - sum_faces(upwind_water_density * F_w_face)
              - water_density_cell * q_w_vol

    For total gas (free + dissolved in oil + water):

        R_g = (phi*V/dt) * (M_g_new - M_g_old)
              - sum_faces(upwind_gas_density*F_g + upwind_oil_density*alpha_Rs_upwind*F_o + upwind_water_density*alpha_Rsw_upwind*F_w)
              - (gas_density_cell*q_g + oil_density_cell*alpha_Rs_cell*q_o + water_density_cell*alpha_Rsw_cell*q_w)

    Densities and Rs/Rsw are frozen during Newton (function of pressure only in
    sequential implicit). There is no PVT volume correction term — the density
    change between old and new pressure levels is embedded in the mass accumulation.

    The `pressure_change_grid` parameter is accepted for signature compatibility
    with calling code but is not used in the mass formulation.
