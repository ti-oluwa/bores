    Assemble the inter-cell flux part of the saturation Jacobian analytically.

    Iterates over all real cells. For each cell and each of its six face
    neighbours the function emits Jacobian entries for both the water and gas
    residual equations with respect to `Sw` and `Sg` of both the current
    cell and the (interior) neighbour. Boundary neighbours (out-of-bounds
    indices) are skipped because their contribution to the Jacobian is zero because
    the boundary flux is prescribed (Dirichlet flux from `pressure_boundaries`)
    or constant (Neumann flux from `flux_boundaries`).

    The assembly follows a thread-safe prange-over-i-slices strategy identical
    to the implicit pressure solver: each i-slice writes into its own row of
    2-D thread-local buffers, so no races occur.  A sequential compaction pass
    at the end flattens those buffers into COO triplets.

    Compute well contributions to the saturation Jacobian.

    Wells contribute only to the diagonal (each perforated cell couples only
    to itself). For BHP-controlled wells the phase well rate depends on
    relative permeability, so the saturation Jacobian has non-zero entries at
    those cells. Rate-controlled injection wells have a fixed rate, so their
    contribution is zero.

    Solve the implicit saturation equations using Newton-Raphson iteration.

    Operates on the `(nx, ny, nz)` grid.  Boundary conditions
    are communicated through the `pressure_boundaries` and `flux_boundaries`
    arrays of shape `(nx+2, ny+2, nz+2)`, which follow the same ghost-cell
    indexing convention as the explicit saturation and implicit pressure solvers:
    a boundary cell at out-of-bounds index `(i_oob, j, k)` is looked up at
    `pressure_boundaries[i_oob + 1, j + 1, k + 1]`.

    The Newton loop iterates on all `nx * ny * nz` cells simultaneously.
    Convergence is declared when the relative residual norm drops below
    `config.newton_tolerance`, or when the maximum saturation change per
    iteration is sufficiently small (quasi-equilibrium acceptance).

    NOTE: All computations and assembly are done in double precision regardless of the `dtype` argument, which only
    controls the dtype of the output saturation grids in the returned `ImplicitSaturationSolution`.
    This is to ensure numerical stability and accuracy of the Newton iterations, which can be sensitive to precision.
