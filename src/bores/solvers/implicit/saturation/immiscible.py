    Compute all relperm and capillary pressure derivative grids for the
    analytical Jacobian.

    **Relperm derivatives**

    All nine raw partials `d kr_alpha / d S_beta` (with `beta in {Sw, So, Sg}`)
    are returned unchanged. The Jacobian kernel projects out the oil saturation
    dependence inline using `dSo/dSw = -1` and `dSo/dSg = -1`.

    **Capillary pressure derivatives projected onto (Sw, Sg) basis**

    Capillary pressures may depend on oil saturation (e.g. a gas-oil table
    indexed by So). The constraint `So = 1 - Sw - Sg` gives
    `dSo/dSw_free = dSo/dSg_free = -1`, so the effective derivatives are:

    ```
    dPcow_dSw_eff = dPcow_dSw + dPcow_dSo * (-1)
    dPcow_dSg_eff =              dPcow_dSo * (-1)
    dPcgo_dSw_eff =              dPcgo_dSo * (-1)
    dPcgo_dSg_eff = dPcgo_dSg + dPcgo_dSo * (-1)
    ```

    These are pre-projected here so the Numba kernel receives simple scalars
    with no further chain-rule work.

    Assemble the (2N x 2N) saturation Jacobian in COO format using analytical
    derivatives of the residual.

    The residual equations are (per interior cell i):

        R_w[i] = (phi*V/dt)*(Sw_i - Sw_old) - sum_faces(F_w_face) - qw - PVT_w
        R_g[i] = (phi*V/dt)*(Sg_i - Sg_old) - sum_faces(F_g_face) - qg - PVT_g

    Face fluxes:

        F_w = lambda_w_up * water_potential * T
        F_g = lambda_g_up * gas_potential * T

        water_potential = (Po_j - Po_i) - (Pcow_j - Pcow_i) - rho_w*g*(z_j - z_i)/144
        gas_potential = (Po_j - Po_i) + (Pcgo_j - Pcgo_i) - rho_g*g*(z_j - z_i)/144

    **Jacobian contributions per face**

    Free variables are Sw and Sg only (So = 1 - Sw - Sg is derived).
    For any phase alpha and free variable beta:

    Effective relperm derivatives (So projected out via dSo/dSw = dSo/dSg = -1):

        dkr_alpha/dSw_eff = dkr_alpha/dSw + dkr_alpha/dSo * (-1)
        dkr_alpha/dSg_eff = dkr_alpha/dSg + dkr_alpha/dSo * (-1)

    Mobility derivative (upwind cell only):

        dF_alpha/dSbeta_up = (k_up * conv / mu_alpha) * (dkr_alpha/dSbeta_eff_up) * delta_Phi_alpha * T

    where 'conv' is 'md_per_cp_to_ft2_per_psi_per_day', the same unit-conversion
    factor applied when building the mobility grids.  Omitting it causes the
    mobility derivative to be mis-scaled relative to the mobility itself,
    producing a structurally incorrect Jacobian.

    Capillary potential derivative (both face cells):

        dF_w/dSbeta = lambda_w_up * (-dPcow_i/dSbeta_eff) * T   when beta belongs to cell i
        dF_w/dSbeta = lambda_w_up * (+dPcow_j/dSbeta_eff) * T   when beta belongs to cell j

    Same pattern for gas with dPcgo.

    Residual convention R = accum - sum_F - wells, so dR/dS = -dF/dS for flux
    terms and +phi*V/dt for the accumulation diagonal.

    Oil relative permeability derivatives (dkro grids) are not needed by the
    water and gas residual equations directly, since the water and gas
    mobilities depend only on krw and krg respectively.  They are omitted from
    the function signature.

    Note: well derivatives are omitted (second-order correction).

    Compute the well contributions to the saturation Jacobian (dR/dS at perforated cells).

    Wells contribute only to the diagonal (each perforated cell couples only to itself).
    For BHP-controlled wells, the phase well rate depends on relative permeability:

        q_alpha = PI_alpha * (P_cell - BHP)     where  PI_alpha = WI * k_abs * conv * kr_alpha / mu_alpha

    Taking the derivative w.r.t. Sw (free variable, So eliminated):

        d(q_alpha)/dSw_eff = WI * k_abs * conv / mu_alpha * dkr_alpha/dSw_eff * (P_cell - BHP)
        dR_alpha/dSw       = -d(q_alpha)/dSw_eff

    For rate-controlled injection wells the rate is fixed, so the saturation derivative is zero.
    Production wells are always BHP-controlled in the saturation Jacobian (rate control fixes
    total surface rate but the phase split still depends on kr).

    The pattern mirrors `compute_well_contributions` in the implicit pressure solver exactly:
    same BHP call signatures, same well index computation, same phase dispatch.
